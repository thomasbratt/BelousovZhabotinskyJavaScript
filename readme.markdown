HodgePodgeJavaScript
====================

A JavaScript animation inspired by a chemical reaction called the 
Belousovï¿½Zhabotinsky reaction. The reaction is described as a nonlinear
chemical oscillator, which sums it up fairly well.

The code is based on a Windows screensaver, which can be found at:

The animation uses the HTML 5 Canvas tag, which may not work well with
some legacy browser versions.

The algorithm used in the animation is described in Gary William Flake's
book *The Computational Beauty of Nature*. The animation is based on
this description, although C code is available (see references section).
